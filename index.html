       <h2><b>Mario Casas Sierra</b></h2>
       <h4>Mario Casas Sierra who is a Spanish actor was born on 12 June, 1986  in Galicia, Spain</h4><br>
       <h3><b>Early Life</b></h3>
       <p>Casas has four siblings. Born in A Coruña, at age four, he left with his family to Barcelona. He moved to the Spanish capital of Madrid, on an adventure, which implied his whole family making the move with him, when he was 18 years old.
        His parents were very young when they had him. His mother, Heidi, was only 17 and his father, Ramon, 19. A year and a half later, they had his sister, Sheila. For Mario, his father is his role model, while his mother and the rest of his siblings are his confidants.
        His mother raised them, and his father worked as a carpenter. Because of his work, his father had no problem moving to another city, so they decided to accompany Mario when he left for Madrid and settled with him in the city.
        Mario has four siblings, forming what he defines a "Sicilian family", a family with many children established around a "matriarch". Mario is the eldest. He is followed by his sister Sheila, and two other brothers, Christian and Oscar. Finally, 
        the youngest member of the family, Daniel, was born in 2014, who he almost considers as his "nephew" because of the enormous age difference.
        He gets along well with all of them, although he shares a special bond with his sister Sheila, as they grew up together. Mario, a loyal tattoo lover, has one dedicated to each of his parents and siblings, with the initials of each one.
        He remembers his childhood as wonderful, although he had a bit of a hard time because he was given a lot of stick for being short. He developed very late. At age 15, he still had the body of the child. Even so, he has always been a flirt, and had his first "girlfriend" at age four.
        As a child he liked everything: singing, dancing, ping-pong, football.... He says he liked trying things out, although he admits that he would get bored easily. His professional career began advertising. He appeared in commercials for Cola Cao, 
        Telepizza, Scalextric... He eventually decided to become an actor after he enrolled at the Cristina Rota School of Dramatic Arts
        He also keeps in touch with lifelong friends from school. Those who have been by his side since he moved to Barcelona. In his own words, they are the ones who keep you on track if you derail, true friends which are hard to find.</p><br><hr><br>

        <h3><b>Acting Career</b></h3>
        <h4><b>2005 - 2010</b></h4>
        <p>Casas began appearing in soap operas from 2005, before earning minor roles in several Spanish films.[3] Mario Casas began his acting career with episode appearances in television series Obsesión (English: Obsession), 
          Motivos personales (Personal Motives) and Mujeres (Women). He came to domestic media attention with his film debut in the 2006 film El camino de los ingleses (Summer Rain), directed by Antonio Banderas.
          That same year he joined the cast of LaSexta series SMS. Casas then reached international audience as Aitor Carrasco in the Antena 3 series Los hombres de Paco (Paco's Men), which he starred from 2007 to 2010.
          In 2009, Casas appeared in two hit films, Fuga de cerebros (Brain Drain) opposite Amaia Salamanca, and Mentiras y Gordas (Sex, Party and Lies) with his bestfriend Yon González,[4] Ana Maria Polvorosa, Ana de 
          Armas and Hugo Silva. Both managed to lead the box office over the weekend of its release. In 2010, Casas starred Tres metros sobre el cielo (Three Steps Above Heaven) opposite María Valverde. It was eventually 
          the highest-grossing Spanish film of the year. A sequel Tengo ganas de ti (I Want You) , which starts Casas, Valverde and Clara Lago, premiered in 2012.[5] In 2010 Casas starred Carne de neon (Neon Meat) directed 
          by Paco Cabezas later that year on 3 December 2010, Tres metros sobre el cielo (Three Steps Above Heaven) opposite María Valverde. It was eventually the highest-grossing Spanish film of the year. He starred Miedo 
          (2010), directed by Jaume Balagueró.</p><br><hr><br>

      <div class="col-lg-8 col-md-7 col-sm-7 text">
        <h4><b>2011 - 2020</b></h4>
          <p>Since 2011, Casas has starred the Antena 3 series El barco (The Boat), he also starred in Tengo ganas de ti (I Want You), premiered in 2012.
             During the late 2013 and early 2014 has shor between Colombia and Chile, his second film project in English called Los 33 (The 33) with Antonio 
             Banderas and Juliette Binoche, a story based on the Chilean mining accident that occurred in 2010. In 2015 Mario starred in the new Álex de la Iglesia 
             comedy film My Great Night and also in the romantic drama film Palmeras en la Nieve (Palm Trees in the Snow), where he repeated with the director of the 
             films Tres metros sobre el cielo (Three Steps Above Heaven) and Tengo ganas de ti (I Want You), Fernando Gonzalez Molina.
             Casas latest role is El fotógrafo de Mauthausen (2018), which tells the story of Francisco Boix, a Spanish republican photographer who was sent to the 
             Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp complex during World War II. Casas lost around 12 kilograms (26 pounds) to play Boix during his imprisonment.
             I find him as one of the greatest actor on the world, since his starring roles in some movies which are "Three metres above the sky", "Three metres above the sky: I want you", 
             "Group 7", "Palm trees in the snow" and "Innocent" can affect me, even make me cry every time when I watch them. That's why I respect him enormously and watch his every movies enthusiastically.
             In my view, If there was another actor instead of him in the films that he played, I believe that that actor couldn't play in heart as him and that films that Mario Casas acted couldn't make
             a huge profit and a big fame.</p>
